# GTSRB-Project-Traffic-Sign-Recognition

A traffic sign recognition approach based on deep learning is proposed in this project. This approach may effectively detect and identify traffic signs by combining picture pre-processing, traffic sign detection, recognition, and classification. Using CNN, deep learning architecture, and several Python and Tensor-Flow libraries, we are developing a model that is faster, more accurate, requires less time, and is unaffected by varied lighting and weather conditions.

We used NumPy, Pandas, OS, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PIL, Tensorflow, Keras, Python, CNN, Machine Learning, Deep Learning to create a Traffic Sign Recognition system using the GTSRB dataset.

How to run the code:
First you need to download the GTSRB dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

Secondly, you can upload this dataset to you Google drive.
Thirdly, after your drive has been mounted in the code mention the correct path in your drive for the image.
Now, the code should run smoothly.

This whole process might take some time so be patient.
